### Working with UDFs in Apache Spark

User-defined functions (UDFs) are a key feature of most SQL environments to extend the systemâ€™s built-in functionality.  UDFs allow developers to enable new functions in higher level languages such as SQL by abstracting their lower level language implementations.  Apache Spark is no exception, and offers a wide range of options for integrating UDFs with Spark SQL workflows.
